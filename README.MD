Description: This class focuses on the fundamentals of how the box-model works. Added in this repository are comments to consider getting curious on how to debug and understand code better. 

P.S. I suggest to understand the basics of debugging, console logging, comments, version control, and developer tools rather than understanding everything. A good habit of feedback, questioning / getting curious, and applying the concepts right away is better than trying to understand it all. Also try to use design tools.

P.P.S. If you're going to look carefully, you'll actually learn something from my code. I do a lot of comments. I know, I know. We live in a world where videos reign. Some do read, and I guess it allows you to practice reading when you check my code out? haha anyway, I primarily do comments as my notes now, instead of putting it on a notebook. Allows me to understand and retain code awareness. But if it also helps other people, then yehey!
