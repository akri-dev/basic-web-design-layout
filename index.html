<!-- For this project, the lessons I learned in class consolidate my skills in converting design to code
Rich started with a pre-made design layout through an app called Sketch.

What I did for this project is I made a HIMYM layout in Figma.
For the past 6 years, I'm glad I consolidate my design fundamentals first before continuing in Web Dev.
It became easier for me to layout a design and understand how CSS works fundamentally.

For this index.html, the major lesson I got was
-if a design exists from a layout such as figma, divide sections
-if it doesn't, design the structure of the html with divisions based on the content idea
-if a design exists, lay down all the content first BEFORE styling the page with CSS
-remember the box model
-USE SEMANTICS WHENEVER POSSIBLE
-USE EMMETS TO CODE FASTER
-for this tutorial or project, I did not apply the components concept where it would work with PHP well because I'm focusing on the basics of Web Layout
